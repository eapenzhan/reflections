Q:What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A:There's a new file called .git. Because there's no version control without initialization.

Q:How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A:It's the files to be commit. It offers us an option that we could commit without necessary files or files we don't want to keep in the repository.
